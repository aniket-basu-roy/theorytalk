{"name":"TheoryTalk","tagline":"Lets Talk Theory","body":"This is a weekly series of informal talks given by people enthusiastic about Theoretical Computer Science. The goal is to have an interactive session discussing _relevant_ papers. The speaker should consider the background of the audience and spend ample time in laying the basics of the paper before going on to the knitty-gritties. Also note this is _not_ a platform to prove one's smartness but mutually learn something new.\r\n\r\n# Week 1\r\n## Abhiruk Lahiri\r\n### TBA","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
