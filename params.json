{"name":"TheoryTalk","tagline":"Let's Talk Theory","body":"This is a weekly series of informal talks given by people enthusiastic about Theoretical Computer Science. The goal is to have an interactive session discussing papers that would broaden our common knowledge. The speaker should consider the background of the audience and spend ample time in laying the basics of the paper before going on to the knitty-gritties. Also note this is _not_ a platform to prove one's smartness but mutually learn something new.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Week 1\r\nSpeaker: Aniket Basu Roy\r\n### Shachar Lovett, Raghu Meka\r\nConstructive Discrepancy Minimization by Walking on The Edges, FOCS 2012 \r\n* [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5747.pdf) \r\n* [tutorial video rather a long one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwCfsKpc2gU) \r\n* [tcs+ video where the first half discusses the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60bnvzm5YY0)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
