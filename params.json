{"name":"TheoryTalk","tagline":"Let's Talk Theory","body":"This is a series of informal talks given by people enthusiastic about Theoretical Computer Science. The goal is to have an interactive session discussing papers/book chapters/any topic that would broaden our common knowledge. The speaker should consider the background of the audience and spend ample time in laying the basics of the material before going on to the knitty-gritties. Also note this is _not_ a platform to prove one's smartness but mutually learn something new.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Week 1\r\nSpeaker: Aniket Basu Roy  \r\n__Shachar Lovett and Raghu Meka.__ _Constructive Discrepancy Minimization by Walking on The Edges_, FOCS 2012 \r\n* [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5747.pdf) \r\n* [tutorial video rather a long one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwCfsKpc2gU) \r\n* [tcs+ video where the first half discusses the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60bnvzm5YY0)  \r\n\r\nIt seems that Random Walking in Polytopes is being used for Approximation Algorithms as well. The following 2 papers are relevant.\r\n* [Thomas Rothvoss. _Approximating Bin Packing within O(log OPT * log log OPT) bins_ FOCS 2013](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4010)\r\n* [Nikhil Bansal, Moses Charikar, Ravishankar Krishnaswamy and Shi Li.\r\n_Better Algorithms and Hardness for Broadcast Scheduling via a Discrepancy Approach_ SODA 2014](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ravishan/bcast-14.pdf)  \r\n\r\nTo know more about Discrepancy Theory in general the following 2 books are available.\r\n* [Bernard Chazelle. The Discrepancy Method](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/book.pdf)\r\n* [Jiri Matousek. Geometric Discrepancy](http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/di.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
